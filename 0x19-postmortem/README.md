# Postmortem: Web Stack Outage Incident

## Issue Summary:
* Duration: Start Time: March 21, 2024, 15:00 UTC; End Time: March 22, 2024, 03:00 UTC
* Impact: Our web application experienced a significant outage, affecting approximately 80% of our users. Users reported inability to access the platform, experiencing slow loading times, and encountering errors during usage.
* Root Cause: The outage was caused by a database connection pool exhaustion due to a sudden surge in incoming traffic.
## Timeline:
* March 2, 2024, 15:15 UTC: Issue detected through monitoring alerts indicating a spike in error rates and latency.
* March 2, 2024, 15:20 UTC: Engineering team notified about the outage.
* March 2, 2024, 15:30 UTC: Initial investigation focused on frontend systems and CDN configurations, assuming the issue might be related to caching or network problems.
* March 2, 2024, 16:00 UTC: Misleading investigation paths pursued including analyzing recent code deployments and server logs for any anomalies.
* March 2, 2024, 17:00 UTC: Incident escalated to senior engineers and database administrators as database performance metrics indicated abnormal behavior.
* March 2, 2024, 18:30 UTC: Database connection pool exhaustion identified as the root cause after extensive analysis of database performance metrics and logs.
* March 2, 2024, 19:00 UTC: Temporary fix implemented by increasing the size of the connection pool to accommodate the surge in traffic.
* March 3, 2024, 03:00 UTC: Permanent solution deployed, optimizing database connection pooling settings and adding auto-scaling capabilities to handle future traffic spikes effectively.
## Root Cause and Resolution:
* Root Cause: The root cause of the outage was the exhaustion of the database connection pool due to a sudden increase in incoming traffic. The default connection pool settings were not sufficient to handle the surge, leading to connection timeouts and service degradation.
* Resolution: The issue was addressed by temporarily increasing the size of the connection pool to alleviate the immediate pressure on the database. A permanent fix was implemented by optimizing the connection pooling settings and introducing auto-scaling mechanisms to dynamically adjust resources based on traffic demand.
## Corrective and Preventative Measures:
* Improvements/Fixes:
Review and optimize database connection pool settings to ensure scalability and resilience under high load conditions.
Enhance monitoring and alerting systems to provide early detection of performance bottlenecks and potential outages.
Conduct regular load testing and capacity planning exercises to anticipate and mitigate issues related to traffic surges.
* Tasks to Address the Issue:
Update database connection pool settings to accommodate increased traffic.
Implement auto-scaling mechanisms for database resources.
Enhance monitoring alerts to include database performance metrics.
Conduct a post-incident review to identify any additional areas of improvement in the incident response process.
Document and communicate lessons learned to the wider engineering team to prevent similar incidents in the future.
